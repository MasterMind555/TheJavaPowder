1. Keep variables where they're used. If they're used in multiple places, have getter and setter functions. Variables.java must go.
3. Element code could be structured like this:
   elements/categories/ for master elements
   elements/ for general elements
   "public class Gunpowder extends Powder, Explosive"
4. Keep some sort of iterating loop over element update functions.
   "if Element in square then 
       Element.update();
	elseif Gunpowder in square then
	   Gunpowder.update();
	"
Feel free to improve, add or remove. It's all for the greater good.
